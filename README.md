# MegaMan: Your Offline Personal AGI Companion

Inspired by **MegaMan Battle Network** and anime-style assistants like **Grok-4/Bella**, **MegaMan** is a stylized **offline personal AGI** designed to deeply understand and grow with its user. Think of it as your Navi — not just a chatbot, but a truly personal cognitive partner.

## What is MegaMan?

MegaMan is:
- An **offline-first AGI** that runs on your local machine
- A **real-time thinking companion** with memory, planning, and reflection
- A UI-powered **anime-style assistant**, adapted from Grok 4 / Jackywine’s Bella

It’s not just an LLM interface. MegaMan learns from you, remembers your preferences, and supports both voice and text communication.

## 🔒 Why Offline?

Your data should be yours. MegaMan is being built to run fully **locally** — no cloud API, no third-party tracking, no vendor lock-in. It’s private, secure, and personal.
